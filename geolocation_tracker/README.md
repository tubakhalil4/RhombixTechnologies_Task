# Geolocation Tracker

This project is part of my internship task at Rhombix Technologies.

It fetches the public IP address of a user and determines their geographical location (country, city, latitude, longitude), then displays it on an interactive map.

## Features
- Get public IP address
- Get geolocation data via IP
- Display location on map using `folium`

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `requests`, `folium`

## How to Run
```bash
python geolocation_tracker.py
